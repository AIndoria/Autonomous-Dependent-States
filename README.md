# Autonomous-Dependent-States
An Autonomous Dependent States mod for Crusader Kings II

[Steam Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1665029657)

**UPDATED TO V 2.0**

**CHANGES**

-  NEW OPTIONS: "Ask to become an Autonomous State" and "Revassalize Autonomous State"
- AI now uses both "Release as Autonomous State" as well as "Ask to become an Autonomous State" options.
- AI will only use the first option if they have very minimal prestige or negative.
- Granting an autonomous state gives a prestige boost of 20. (Testing phase, might adjust later).
- You can ReVassalize the autonomous states after 2 years(testing). They can also bribe you and rebel to keep their autonomy.
- Autonomous Vassals can no longer be called to wars
- Adjusted factors for AI to increase chances of rejecting becoming an Autonomous State if they have chance to gain the throne (Are among two most powerful vassals), or if their relative power to the ruler is more than 5.
- Updated to support the latest CK2 version (3.2.1)


------------



Release your vassals as autonomous dependencies which act as tributaries.

Ever wished that your big empire would break into smaller "autonomous" states which you don't have to micromanage? Look no further. With this mod, you can release a vassal as their own independent dependency. They will do whatever they like, they'll just give you some gold and troops in exchange. (Think Rome-Armenia in the antiquity or Post Alexandrian Diodochi). You can choose to release such states, ask to become an autonomous state of another state, as well as reannex such states.


------------


You can right click on someone's picture, click "Release as Dependent State."

- An autonomous state will give you 25% of their income and troops, and in exchange you have to protect them.
- They can fight other similar autonomous states, but you can intervene in any such wars.
- You will gain 0.1 prestige+piety every month from such interactions. 


----

**Here's how it works in simple terms:**

1. You offer a vassal independence and protectorate status.
2. Generally, they're more than likely to accept (Hey, independence!).
3.  However, if they're among the first two most powerful vassals and are likely to inherit/get the entire realm, they'll try to bribe you or outright refuse, in which case, they might choose to go to war.
4.  If you win the war, you get to imprison them and then you can release them and they will accept.


--------

**Near Future Goals**

- Give your vassals a 30 day ultimatum, in which duration they might be able to gather support from other vassals who like them more than you to plead on their behalf. They might offer you money/favors and rejection might mean them banding together against you.
- Granting Autonomy to HRE dukes/kings makes them "Princes."
- Revassalizing autonomous state is a bit wonky right now, but it works for the most part. I'll work on making sure it works 100% of the time. There are some bugs like sometimes there is no wardec after they break off.


**Incompatibility**
Does not work well with CK2+, as it already has those options integrated. It WILL work if you force it to, but weird things happen, like some options never showing up in character context menu.
